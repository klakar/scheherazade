# QGIS Story
This is a QGIS plug-in that makes it possible to create web based geographic map stories. The stories requires only a web browser to view. It can be online or off-.

Directly from a QGIS dockable panel and simple forms. Storys can be saved, edited, published and more. Storys are based on OpenLayers3 and any "web" based active layers in the current project.

The story is styled with selectable, and customisable css templates, and based on a html template, that it self is also customisable.
