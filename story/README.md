# QGIS Story
This is a QGIS plug-in that makes it possible to create web based geographic map stories.

Directly from a QGIS dockable panel and simple forms. Storys can be saved, edited, published and more. Storys are based on OpenLayers3 and any "web" based layers in the current project.
## Project Status
This is **not** production ready!!!

It's not even Beta!!!
